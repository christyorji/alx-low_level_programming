In this program, we use the write function to write the specified message to the standard error file descriptor (STDERR_FILENO). We use strlen to get the length of the message and compare it with the return value of write to check for any errors during the writing process.

The program adheres to the requirements you specified: not using functions from the printf or puts families listed in the man pages, returning 1 from the main function, and compiling without any warnings when using the -Wall gcc option.

When you compile and run this program, it will print the message to the standard error stream:

The program will return 1, indicating program execution.

In this program, the main function is commented using the documentation style comments specified by the Betty coding style. The comments describe the purpose of the function and the return value.

The program uses the write function to write the specified message to the standard error file descriptor (STDERR_FILENO). It checks the return value of write against the length of the message to verify if there was any error during the writing process.

The program adheres to the requirements you specified: not using functions from the printf or puts families listed in the man pages, returning 1 from the main function, and compiling without any warnings when using the -Wall gcc option.

When you compile and run this program, it will print the following message to the standard error:

In this program, the main function is commented using the documentation style comments specified by the Betty coding style. The comments describe the purpose of the function and the return value.

The program uses a loop to write the message in chunks to the standard error file descriptor (STDERR_FILENO). The loop continues until the entire message is written or an error occurs. It checks the return value of write to handle any potential errors.

The program adheres to the requirements you specified: not using functions from the printf or puts families listed in the man pages, returning 1 from the main function, and compiling without any warnings when using the -Wall gcc option.
